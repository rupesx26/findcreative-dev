                          Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot

                          industry standard practices to protect your privacy,
                          we do not promise, and you should not expect, that
                          your personally identifiable information or private
                          communications would always remain private. As a

                          personally identifiable information about you to any
                          third party. However, the following describes some of
                          the ways that your personally identifiable information
                          may be disclosed: a. External Service Providers: There
                          may be a number of services offered by external
                          service providers that help you use our Websites. If

                          course of doing so, disclose information to the
                          external service providers, and/or grant them
                          permission to collect information about you, then
                          their use of your information is governed by their
                          private policy. b. Other Corporate Entities: We share
                          much of our data, including personally identifiable
                          information about you, with our parent and/or
                          subsidiaries that are committed to serving your online
                          needs and related services, throughout the world. Such
                          data will be shared for the sole purpose of enhancing
                          your browsing experience and providing our services to
                          you. To the extent that these entities have access to
                          your information, they will treat it at least as
                          protectively as they treat information they obtain
                          from their other members. It is possible that We
                          and/or its subsidiaries, or any combination of such,
                          could merge with or be acquired by another business
                          entity. Should such a combination occur, you should
                          expect that we would share some or all of your
                          information in order to continue to provide the
                          service. You will receive notice of such event (to the
                          extent that it occurs). c. Law and Order: We
                          co-operate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as
                          other third parties to enforce laws, such as:
                          intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights.

                          an investigation of fraud, intellectual property
                          infringements, or other activity that is illegal or
                          may expose us or you to legal liability.
