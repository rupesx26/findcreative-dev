Kratos Overseas, has been a traditional chocolate importer for a number of years and decided to enter the confectionary market with his own chocolate brand-Socranos. Having identified that Cadbury FUSE is a highly sought-after chocolate in the Gujarat market but not picked-up impulsively due to the high price-point of Rs. 35/-, the Client decided to come up with a product that would compete with FUSE albeit at a lower price point. Keeping these details in mind,our design strategy was to ride on the Cadbury lineage of the purple brand color and FUSE design, and carefully create a design that would givethe customer the impression of actually buyinga FUSE chocolate but at a lower price point.
